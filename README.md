Alloy UI Font Awesome Cheatsheet
================================

*(Just want to see the icons? [Here's the Web version!](http://nickpiesco.github.io/alloy-ui-font-awesome-cheatsheet/))*

[Alloy UI 2.0](http://alloyui.com/) (new in [Liferay Portal 6.2](http://www.liferay.com/products/liferay-portal/liferay-portal-6.2)) ships with its own version of [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/), which, though appropriately awesome, as far as I can tell doesn't *quite* match up with any existing Font Awesome documentation out there.

The HTML was generated by looping over the AUI icon classes in [Velocity](http://velocity.apache.org/). I'm including the source if you'd like to try it out yourself &ndash; create a structure with an empty field (it doesn't matter what kind of field it is, since you're not going to be reading it into the template), assign the template to it, and go. If that didn't make sense, just paste the HTML into a piece of Web content. :smile:
